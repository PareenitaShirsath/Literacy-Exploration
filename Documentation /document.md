## 📄 Documentation
This repository includes clear and structured documentation to help understand the project workflow, data usage, and analysis process. The documentation explains:

- The objective and scope of the literacy analysis  
- Data sources and assumptions used during analysis  
- Steps followed for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization  
- Interpretation of key insights derived from the analysis  
- How analytical results were converted into visual stories  

The documentation is designed to be **beginner-friendly** and enables readers to easily follow the complete lifecycle of the project—from raw data analysis in the Jupyter Notebook to final insights presented in the PowerPoint presentation.
