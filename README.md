# Literacy-Exploration
Visual storytelling project analyzing India’s literacy landscape using Census and Times of India data. The project highlights state-wise disparities, gender gaps, social group comparisons, and trends over time, presented through insightful visualizations and a narrative-driven PowerPoint presentation.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is derived from publicly available sources including the **Census of India (2011)** and literacy-related reports published by **The Times of India**. It contains literacy statistics across Indian states and union territories.

### Key Features of the Dataset:
- State / Union Territory name  
- Overall literacy rate (%)  
- Male literacy rate (%)  
- Female literacy rate (%)  
- Urban literacy rate (%)  
- Rural literacy rate (%)  
- Year of observation (where applicable)  

📌 *Assumptions were made where required by supplementing data from government reports and sample datasets to maintain consistency across visualizations.*

## 📓 Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) Description
The Jupyter Notebook file included in this repository is used for **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization**.

### The notebook performs the following tasks:
- Loading and inspecting the literacy dataset  
- Handling missing or inconsistent values  
- Analyzing literacy trends over different years  
- Identifying highest and lowest literacy states  
- Comparing literacy rates based on gender and region  
- Creating visualizations such as:
  - Bar charts
  - Line charts
  - Distribution and comparison plots  

The insights generated from the notebook are then translated into **visual stories and summary slides** within the PowerPoint presentation.

📌 *The notebook serves as the analytical backbone of the project, while the presentation focuses on storytelling and communication of insights.*
